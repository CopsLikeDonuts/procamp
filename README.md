1) Create folder with the name you like.
2) Open this folder in any editor.
3) You need to initialize local repository. Check your path in the     editor terminal (it should be equal to folder path) and type "git init".
4) Then you need to bind your local repository to github repo. To do this type "git remote add origin https://github.com/CopsLikeDonuts/procamp.git" in your editor terminal .
5) Now you can download files to your directory. Type "git pull https://github.com/CopsLikeDonuts/procamp.git" .
6) Next you need to download dependencies. Type npm i in your editor terminal (if you dont't have npm package visit [https://nodejs.org/] and install latest stable version).
7) After dependencies are loaded, you can start this proj on your local server (included in react "stock" builder). Change your directory to "src" (cd src) and type "npm start".
8) Here you go, the app is launched on your local server.
9) If you have any questions or problems, contact me.
